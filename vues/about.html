                            <p>This tool focuses on generating localized forecasts for select locations based on NASA GMAO's GEOS Composition Forecasting (GEOS-CF). Some of the location data are provided by OpenAQ. Using this library, you can train and load models based on you location data online and measure the uncertainty of the forecast based on the data provided.</p>
